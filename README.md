# Password Generator

## Description

On this site, I have created a password generator. When the user clicks on the button entitled 'Generate Password' there is a hover effect and it will become black. After this they will be given a choice of how many characters they wish to have in their password. If they choose less than 8, greater than 128 or anything that is not a number they will be directed back to the initial question. When they have answered correctly, they will be taken through a series of window prompts asking if they would like special characters, uppercase letters, lowercase letters or numbers in their password. 
Once all of the parameters have been selected for the user's password, the new generated password will be written in the password box on the page.
